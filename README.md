# Cipher

> **Portfolio Mirror:** This repository serves as a showcase of my frontend engineering work on the **Cipher** project.

## My Role & Contributions
I acted as the **Lead Frontend Contributor**, responsible for the application's visual identity, user experience (UX), and interactive elements.

**Key highlights of my work:**
* **Advanced Animations:** Implemented smooth, 60fps UI transitions using **Reanimated**.
* **Sensory UX:** Integrated **Haptic Feedback** (`expo-haptics`) to enhance user interaction and tactile feel.
* **Modern Navigation:** Built the app structure using **Expo Router** for seamless screen transitions.
* **Vector Graphics:** Used **SVG** for crisp, scalable UI assets independent of screen density.
* **Clean UI Architecture:** Styled components using native `StyleSheet` for maximum performance and explicit control over layout.
